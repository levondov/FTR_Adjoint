# Optimization of Flat-to-Round (FTR) Transformers Using Adjoint Techniques

This repo contains all the simulation code used in applying adjoint techniques to optimize an accelerator lattice according to a Flat-to-Round transformation.

More information on the theory can be found in this arXiv paper: [2102.07016](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07016)
