Things to investigate

Editor comments

fig1 - remove unncessary square border to figure if possible
all figs - remove grid on lines
all figs - change matplotlib 1e-x to 10^x
fig5 - change Log to log and make it log_{10}

Reviewer A

Easy fixes:
all figs - change 1e-x to 10^x
change all Fig x to Fig. x
change all Eq (x) to Eq. x?


other fixes:
- discuss constant of motion in Eq. 21
    - reference [24] for this constant of motion not clear. Discuss CoM further.
    
- more analysis on nonlinear edge fields (in solenoid + quads) what effect does it have on
optimization

- synchrotron radiation effects? Does adjoint method work?


Reviewer B

Easy fixes:

other fixes:

- why represent in larmor frame. GUI program already exists to optimize linear space charge.

- the FTR transformer conditions for electron cooling are independent of space-charge.



- investigate FoM to optimize between radial oscillations and angular momentum.
- investigate equations
- eq (39) should be Q+
